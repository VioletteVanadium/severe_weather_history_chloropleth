Gathers data from storm events data from NOAA and uses mini-batch k-means clustering to generate labels to rank event severity. This severity metric is then used to generate a chloropleth map highlighting areas of the country in which bad weather occurs more often and/or is more severe.

To use: run <code>./main.sh</code> and open the resulting <code>map.html</code> in a browser.
